I will use this file to document my work on the project. My impression of SQL and Azure is that it won't be easy to show much beyond a testable project. 
Since I want to showcase the development process, I'll be taking notes here.

I created an SQL server using my Azure for Students account. I'm unfamiliar with Azure in general, but I've managed to open the project on
Azure Data Studio. I'm considering this a good start for today. My first goal will be the construction of the database. I want the database
to work on an isolated level before I get deep into other Azure tools. I would ideally share the database and server here, but I want to 
ensure the security is good with permissions and network access first. I don't want other people to edit the server,so I need to look into 
permissions and things like that.

Database Structure
I may include a drawing later, but I'll try to include a basic text version here.
Days-MealMenu-Meals-MealTags
Meals-MealTagsForbidden
Days-DrinkMenu-Drinks-DrinkTags

Days:MealMenu - 1:M
MealMenu:Meals - M:1
Meals:MealTags - 1:M
Meals:MealTagsForbidden - 1:M
Days:DrinkMenu - 1:M
DrinkMenu:Drinks - M:1
Drinks:DrinkTags - 1:M

Basic idea is that the database can track daily operations. Days will track each day of operation. 
The Menu tables are linking tables. They link a given day to meals and drinks offered. Tags are properties of different meals and drinks
that customers may like or dislike. Users should be able to search meals and drinks to find different types like associated tags or prices,
and the user can map these to days that the meals and drinks were served alongside profits.
I'm hoping I can expand this to include different character data as well. I'm also curious how well SQL inherently works with trend-focused data,
but I'm also planning to use other tools to track this as well.

I managed to create tables in the database. I was having some problems because I'm still
new to how Azure databases are structured. I accidently created a table in the master branch
because the connections needed to be changed. The default was master, so I needed to manually
enter the branch/db I was using. The connections in general are still confusing, so I'll probably
look into them more in the future.
